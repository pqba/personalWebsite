                    Getting my first <u>paying</u> job as an IT intern this summer has been an eye opening experience. It's a shift from summer camps, engineering programs, and very late night Youtube binge sessions for sure. There are frustrating and confusing moments where I feel like I don't quite know the etiquette for addressing blockers or explaining ideas, but there is a shift that happens once you begin to work for an organization. <br><br>Even though I'm mostly siloed in with my supervisor and another coworker during my shift, through visits to other departments, getting onboarded by various members in the org and generally learning more about it from the website I'm actually astounded by how much I'm starting to piece together the broader <em>business logic</em> through osmosis or perhaps pure interest. It's also been great to speak with other interns and new people in the org and it was funny to (just last week) hear about a project in our biweekly meeting that I know another intern is working through.<br><br>As for the work itself, I am starting to pick up and contribute after learning more about network fundamentals, reviewing the confusing jargon. I'm learning and applying ideas of data persistence, replication, and cloud infrastructure. I hope to showcase and talk about a derivative project based on the work I'm doing here.
